- indent html code for js
- tests for js code
- default function args

- some way to specify body when elem is created w block

- test a longer salty file converted to php and js

const elem = React.createElement("div", {
    children: "Hello World",
    className: "container"
    });

ReactDOM.render(element, rootElement)


OR

const elem = React.createElement("div", {
    className: "container"
    },
    "Hello World", // add as many args as you want for the children
    "Goodbye World"
    );

ReactDOM.render(element, rootElement)


React for creating elements, REactDOM for rendering to the page


- passing callbacks down a react tree is painful, one solution would be to use a state monad

- optional (foo?.bar) stuff is useless, delete

The goal isn't to have every PHP feature in here, but there are definitely some notable things missing right now that I'd like to add sometime.

- try/catch statements
- pass by reference (`foo = &bar`)
- function arg defaults (foo a=1 := a + 1)

chaining optionals for hash keys like

    :foo.bar?.baz?

would be cool.

Stuff I don't care about:
- switch statements (though guards for functions like haskell would be cool)
